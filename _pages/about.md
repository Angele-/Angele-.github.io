I'm a PhD student at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna, Sweden. I'm interested in all things planetary science, especially by space instrumentation and the way it shapes the science we're doing in the Solar System. I want to learn how space instruments work and how we can improve them to do better science. Currently I'm involved with assembling, testing and calibrating the Jovian Neutrals Analyzer, an instrument for the JUICE mission to Jupiter.
