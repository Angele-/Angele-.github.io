I'm a PhD student at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna, Sweden. I'm involved with assembling, testing and calibrating the Jovian Neutrals Analyzer, an instrument for the JUICE mission to Jupiter. To make sure we'll correcly interpret the data we'll receive from Jupiter, I also simulate the processes that creates Energetic Neutral Atoms (the particles our instrument will  observe) at Ganymede.
