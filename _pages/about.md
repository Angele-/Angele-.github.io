I'm a PhD student at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna, Sweden. I'm interested in all things planetary science, especially by space instrumentation and the way it shapes the science we're doing in the Solar System. Currently I'm involved with assembling, testing and calibrating the Jovian Neutrals Analyzer, an instrument for the JUICE mission to Jupiter.
